## Installation

Generally, python 3.9 and torch 1.9.0 are used. Follow these steps to setup your environment:

1. Create a pip environment with Python 3.9 (assumes python3 refers to Python version 3.9)
```
/path/to/python3.9 -m venv p39
```
2. Activate the environment. You will need to activate the pip environment in each terminal in which you want to use this code.
```
source p39/bin/activate
```
3. Install the appropriate version of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For me this looks like
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
4. If prompted, upgrade pip (mine is 24.0), because "newer is better" üëç 
```
/path/to/python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
5. To view the emoji above, open this file in vscode and install the "Emoji" extension by Perkovec, a necessity for coding (I use emoji's as variable names in my code, and before raising an issue, I do not care).
4. Install the requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
